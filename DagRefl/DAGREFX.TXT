DAGREFX - Program to change the Monster's Reflex's in Daggerfall

INTRODUCTION
======================================
DAGREFX is a program I created for the great demand to be able to change the
monster reflex value selected during character creation in DAGGERFALL. The
reflex value affects how quickly monsters attack and affects how quickly your
character increases his/her skills percentages (the character will get better
in skills more quickly with the monster reflex's set at Highest to compensate
for the increased playing difficulty). Likewise, it may also affects how long
your character survives, especially if playing a potentially weak character.
Many have complained that they could not change this value after creating the
character, finding the monsters either too easy, or too diificult, and do not
wish to start a new character.  This program can display and change this value
with little difficulty (no HEX-editting nessecary).


INSTALLATION
======================================
Simply unzip or copy DAGREFX.EXE into the main DAGGERFALL directory (such
as C:\DAGGER) and execute.


GENERAL NOTES
======================================
- It's always a good idea to backup the SAVETREE.DAT files in the save game
  slots you wish to edit.
- Valid save game numbers are from 0 to 5.  When in the save/load screen
  in Daggerfall, the slots are numbered as follows...

			Save 0  Save 3
			Save 1  Save 4
			Save 2  Save 5

- The character name is needed as the position of the reflex value in the
  file is not fixed relative to the file beginning.  It is fixed, however,
  relative to the beginning of the character's name.
- The name is not case sensitive (Fiet is equivilant to fIeT).
- The name can be shortened (in case you forget the full name of a character)
  but should be as much as possible.
- Although I have tested this program, I cannot be held responsible to any
  damage incurred through its use.
- It may be possible that this isn't the monster reflex byte, although it's 
  highly likely that it is.  On a test character I compared a rats attacks  
  on Lowest and Highest reflex settings based on my findings. On highest, 
  the rat attacked pretty much every 2 seconds or quicker.  On the lowest 
  reflex setting, it varied widely, but was typically 2-3 seconds apart.  
  Not a big difference, but I did notice I died much more quickly on the 
  higher setting.


TECHNICAL+PROGRAM NOTES
======================================
This program is based on the fact that the monster reflex chosen at character
creation is 130 bytes (82h) from the beginning of the character's name in the
SAVETREE.DAT file in each save game slot.  The character in this position
gives the value chosen by the following

	Highest - 0
	High    - 1
	Average - 2
	Low     - 3
	Lowest  - 4

This was determined by creating several as exact as possible characters with 
different monster reflex settings and then comparing the files. Eventually, 
by eliminating byte difference locations one can determine this (it took over 
an hour or so to determine this, including the actual character creation in 
DF).  Since I only had a few files to work with, I cannot be 100% sure that 
this will work with every savegame.  There should be enough safeties built 
into the program to catch this and prevent writing to a savegame file that 
doesn't match the known case, but it is possible that it won't.  In any
case, backing up the SAVETREE.DAT file is a good idea.  I can't be held 
responsible for any file mangling this program does (even though it shouldn't)

This program may be freely modified/copied/distributed.  Although I've tried
to use good programming practices and well commented code, the code is there
to use/view at your own risk.

The string searching algorithm used can probably be improved quite a bit as
it is probably quite slow.  A better way might be load a large chunk of the
file into memory and scan it instead of reading one character at a time was 
much easier to program.


FORMAT
======================================
DAGREFX v0.10  Copyright (c) 1996 - Dave Humphrey
Edits the ES:DAGGERFALL file savetree.dat in the specified savegame directory
and displays/changes the monster reflex value chosen during character creation

	DAGREFX savegame character [/R:new reflex]

	     savegame - The savegame number, 0-5, you wish to change.
	    character - The name of the character in the savegame.
      [/R:new reflex] - Change the monster reflex value to this. The acceptable
			values are as follows...
				  Highest - 0
				     High - 1
				  Average - 2
				      Low - 3
				   Lowest - 4

If a new reflex value is not given, the current value will simply
be displayed. Comments can be E-Mailed to: aj589@freenet.carleton.ca


EXAMPLES
======================================

	DAGREFX 0 Mordalis Lonfallew
		Displays the current reflex setting in savegame slot #1 for
		the character named 'Mordalis Lonfallew'.

	DAGREFX 0 mordal
		Same as above but with shortened name.

	DAGREFX 3 Fiet Falhorn /R:highest
		Display and change the reflex value in savegame slot 3
		to the highest value.

	DAGREFX 3 Fiet Falhorn /R:0
		Same as above with numeric reflex value used.
