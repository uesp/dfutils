DFSpell is a program which edits the SPELLS.STD file found in the ARENA2
directory of Daggerfall.  This allows the default spells sold in the mages
guild to be editted, removed or even new spells added.

This version is solely a developers release of the program.  This means that
there is no help accompaning the program and bugs may still exist.  It is
meant for those well familiar with hacking and editting Daggerfall files.
Most likely there will be a fuller release later on with proper documentation
and any bug fixes that were found.

To install, merely unzip or copy the program into the Daggerfall directory.
The files DFSPELL.RC must accompany the EXE file.

Developers Notes:
  - The program contains a lot of new code and as such probably has lots of
    bugs hidden somewhere.  Let me know if you find any.  The following
    areas contain the new code.
	- VGA GUI. Extended from the old text GUI code so there shouldn't
	  be too much problems here.
	- The menu system is new but appears to work quite well.
	- The RC parsing system.  This allows all the GUI objects to be
	  described in a text file rather than in the code itself.  This
	  makes the code much neater, easier to read, and you don't need to
	  recompile to move objects around.
  - The program has been tested several times and appears to be able to
    load and save the STD file with no problems.  Adding spells also works
    although there may be a limit within the game as to how many one can
    add.
  - The program attempts to load SPELLS.STD and ARENA2\SPELLS.STD when it
    starts.
