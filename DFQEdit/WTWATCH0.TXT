Dear %pcn,<
 <
    Queen Akorithi of Sentinel spoke highly of you as a<
 brave, able, and unprejudiced %ra. Her actual<
 words were 'a hero.' For some time, we have been<
 looking for someone like that.<
    I will not lie to you about our loyalties. We<
 serve the Underking. If you are a believer in fairy<
 tales and consider the Underking the ultimate force of<
 evil, we apologize for misjudging you. Otherwise, we<
 need your help. You can find me at _agentplace_<
 of __agentplace_ in Sentinel. I will wait one month.<
