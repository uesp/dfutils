This is indeed the Dust of Restful Death.<
 As for that letter, it was from Gortwog<
 to me, though I never got it. I heard from<
 him later that his orc warriors were slain<
 attempting to ambush the assassins. Gortwog<
 and his orcs are not the villains most<
 people seem them as.<
 <
 Eadwyre and the court of Wayrest have never<
 been particularly loyal to the empire. To<
 assassinate a king is treason. I will have<
 my revenge, but first I must find out why<
 Eadwyre would risk this.<
 <
 I will need a month to prepare the Dust.<
 Come back to me at that time and I will<
 give it to you, along with instructions<
 for its use.<
