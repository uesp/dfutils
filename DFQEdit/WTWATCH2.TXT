You will. Hmm. Remarkable. The Necromancers|
 have taken an item of ours, a _reward_|
 of some value. The value is of secondary|
 concern. The true problem is that they cursed|
 this item and gave it to the Blades. If you|
 are unaware, the Blades were once the honor|
 guard for Tiber Septim. Today they are loyal|
 to the empire and Tiber's code, but not|
 always to the current emperor. The Underking|
 has reason to not wish harm upon the Blades.|
 We want you to infiltrate Castle Llugwych|
 in Ykalon and remove the _reward_.|
 Please have this done in =itemindung_ days if|
 you want your information and reward.|
