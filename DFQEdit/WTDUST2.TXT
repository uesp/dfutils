Your vision hazes and the world grows|
 dim. Out of the gray, a woman's face|
 appears. Medora!|
 |
 "%pcf. Your efforts to free me<
 have not been in vain. I have discovered<
 a powder that will soothe the ghost of<
 my beloved Lysandus. However, it is in the<
 hands of Gortwog, Warlord of the Orcs, in<
 his steel citidel of Orsinium. Go to him<
 in Orsinium and see if there is anything<
 that can be done to persuade him to give<
 it to you. Bring the powder to me in<
 Direnni Tower once you have it."<

 The vision clears. Sometimes you wish|
 sorceresses would just send letters like|
 other folks do.|
