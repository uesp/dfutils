IMPORTANT Note Before Beginning
======================================================
This document was created assuming you know the basics of hex editing and
programming (not much), or, for the more technically minded.  If you aren't
one of these, you may not wish to read furthur.  The byte locations are 
always given in decimal, while numeric bytes from the files are always in
hexadecimal (base 16) whether indicated (0x10, 10h) or not.  Remember that
arrays start with element 0.  So qbn_offset[6] would actually be the 7th
offset contained in the QBN header.

When I write a byte sequence from a file (ex: 76 A4) the numbers are assumed
to be hexadecimal. The order of the bytes is unchanged from the file (ex: the
bytes 00 01 are not a '1' but actually 0x0100 or 256).

Unless a particular section or list of values have (confirmed) marker the
information is not set in stone.  A (confirmed) mark indicates that the
value has been tested.  In the case of NULL bytes or complete list of 
possible values, a (confirmed) mark indicates that all quest file have been 
looked at, including the CompUSA ones.



QUEST FILENAME FORMAT
======================================================
Individual quests are composed of two different files found in the ARENA2
Daggerfall directory, the QRC and the QBN file.  Each set of QRC/QBN files
appear to contain only one quest, which may have different parts.  The name 
of these files affects several aspects of the quest such as which guild the 
quest belongs to etc... This format is followed by all quests except for ones
which begin with $, _, or S.  The almost complete filename format of quest 
files can be found below.  

   Quest Filename Format
	[Byte 0] = Represents which guild the quest belongs to. See 
		   Appendix D for a complete list of guild filenames.
	[Byte 1] = Always a '0'
	[Byte 2] = The PC's status relative to guild. 
			A       Joining Guild Quest
			B       Member's Only Quest
			C       Non-Member's Quest
	[Byte 3] = A number ranging from 0 to 8. In guilds, this represents 
		   the minimum rank the PC must be to receive the quest.  In 
		   other quests, this seems to refer to the reputation of the 
		   PC with the faction giving the quest.
	[Byte 4] = Is almost always a '0' but a few quests have a '1', 'X' or 
		   an 'A' here.
	[Byte 5] = Method in which the quest is given to the PC. 
			Y       Quest is Given in Person
			L       Quest is Given by a Letter
     [Bytes 6+7] = The quest number, used to differentiate one quest from 
		   another.


The QRC Files
======================================================
The QRC files contain all the text needed for the quest. The format of these 
files appears to be completely understood.

[Bytes 0-1] = unsigned int header_length
	Integer Length of header information in QRC file.  Add 2 bytes offset
	to this to get to beginning of text data (usually?)

The next parts are 6 bytes section repeated until end of header.
[Begin Section]
  [Bytes 0-1] = unsigned int text_offset_type
  [Bytes 2-5] = unsigned long int text_offset
	This gives information about a certain section of text in the QRC 
	file.  The text_offset_type gives what kind of text the text_offset     
	is pointing to.  text_offset gives the start location of the text in
	the QRC file in bytes from beginning of file.

	text_offset_type (Hex)       Text Type
       ========================   ===========================================
		E8 03               Text seen when 'Get Quest' is Pressed
		E9 03               When you turn down the quest
		EA 03               When you accept the quest
		EB 03               'Don't Bother Me' type questor message
		EC 03               Guild quest complete message
		ED 03               Information/Rumours?
		EE 03               Rumours?
		EF 03               Message seen when Quest monster killed
		F0 03               Information/Rumours?
		F1 03               Quest fail message at guild
		F2 03               Quest Log Entry
		F3 03               Message when Quest item found on body?
		10 04               Message when Quest item found on ground?
		15 04               Failure message when Quest time expires

  Example: F2 03 54 01 00 00
	This would mean the text data related to the quest log entry can be
	found 154h bytes (thats 340 decimal bytes) from the beginning of the
	QRC file.
[End Section]

There will be a variable number of these sections in the header of the QRC 
file.  They end when text_offset_type = (FF FF).  The next two bytes after
this are the ones I can't explain, but it is likely they are simply padding
bytes and are not used (I hope). After these two bytes are two padding zero
or null characters followed by all the text data.

[Text Sections]
As described above, the location and types of the text sections are given in
the header information.  The text sections themselves contain many symbols
which need to be explained.

  [0xFC Character] - This represents the end of a left-justified line, like a 
	CR (carriage return). This appears to be only used in the log entry.
  [0xFD Character] - This represents the end of a centered line. The text line
	is centered in the current text window. 
  [0xFE Character] - This may also represent a CR, but more importantly it
	signals an end of a text section.  The next byte after this one will
	be the first text character in the next text section (see header
	description for more information).
  [0xFF Character] - Although only one individual quest is contained within
	each QRC/QBN file, there can be multiple descriptions of that quest.
	This character seperates these multiple descriptions in each text
	section (this appears to be optional).
  [%string] - Any string preceded with a '%' indicates some sort of variable
	is to be inserted there.  '%pcf' indicates the characters full name,
	'%pcn' only the first name, etc...  A much more complete listing of
	these can be found in Appendix A at the end of this document.
  [_string_] - Any string preceded and ended with a '_' indicates some sort
	of location/item, probably a randomly generated one.  This can be a 
	house, dungeon, castle, fort, or some gold, a magic item, etc...  
	For location types, the number of _'s preceding the string determines 
	what location type to be displayed.  A list of all known types of 
	these can be found in Appendix B at the end of this document.

			String          Location Type
		      ============     ================
			_string_         Name (such as name of house or
					       name of person)
		       __string_         City
		       ___string_        Place (such as dungeon name or house
						where someone is)
		       ____string_       Province

  [=string_] - Any string preceded with a '=' and ended with a '_' is another
	sort of variable type.  Common types of these include length of 
	quests.  The exact different between this and other variable types
	is not understood (what is the difference between '=reward_' and  
	'_reward_' ?)
[End Text Sections]

That basically concludes the description of the QRC files, which appears to
be very much complete and well understood.  We still need, however, a better
understanding of the %string and _string_ variables, including a complete
listing of them all (see Appendix A, B and C)



The QBN Files
======================================================
The QBN quest files are the heart and soul of the quest.  It is they which
tell Daggerfall what kind of quest, quest rewards, location, monsters, items,
etc...  Unfortunately, discovering the complete format of the QBN file is
going to be very difficult, if not impossible, since this file is completely
numeric Hex data (ugh!).  The only for-sure method I have of hacking this
at the moment is to change a byte, run Daggerfall, get the quest, and see
what, if any, has changed...definitly a very slow method but significant
progress has been made.

[Bytes 0-14] - These appear to always be 0 (confirmed)

[Byte 15] - unsigned char section10
	In all but seven files, this byte is 0. In those seven files this
	byte is a 1. This signifies that there is a tenth section at the end
	of the QBN file.

[Bytes 16-35] - unsigned int qbn_section_size[10]
	20 Bytes of section sizes. These sizes are record, not byte, sizes.
	The record size of the 10 sections in bytes are as follows.

	     Section        # bytes (base 10)
	    =========      ===========================
		0               19
		1               unknown (no entries)
		2               unknown (no entries)
		3               20
		4               24
		5               unknown (no entries)
		6               33
		7               14
		8               87
		9               8
	       10               27

	Sections 1, 2, and 5 always have a size of 0 (confirmed). The 10th
	section is contained in only 7 QBN DF files. There is no associated
	section size with this and the section data is always at the end of
	the QBN file.

[Bytes 36-57] - unsigned int qbn_section_offset[11]
	Another 22 Bytes of offsets to those sections. Only 7 QBN DF files
	contain the 10th section offset which is always the last one.

[Bytes 58-59] - unsigned int nothing;
	2 Padding bytes which seem to be always 0 (confirmed).

The file up to this point is always the same in structure. What follows 
depends on the qbn_section_size[] and qbn_section_offset[] values.  


[Offset Descriptions]
  I have only investigated several offsets which comprise only a part of the
  QBN files, but its progress.

  [qbn_section_offset[0] - Bytes 36 to 37 - 19 Bytes Long]
	This section contains all items which are required in the quest, from
	gold rewards, letters, and ingrediants, etc...
    [Bytes 0] - unsigned char section_index
		Since there can be several occurences of the same section,
		this represents which one we are current reading.
    [Bytes 1-2] - unsigned int reward
		00 00 = Artifact Reward
		00 01 = Item Reward
		00 02 = Gold Reward
		00 03 = ??? Appears only in A0C01Y09
	Definitely appears to be related to the base type of reward. These
	values appear to be the only valid ones here (after searching through
	all DF quests (including the CompUSA ones).
    [Bytes 3-6] - unsigned long reward_type
		FF FF FF FF = Random reward type?
		00 00 FF FF = No Gold reward (like in kill the rats quest)?
		05 00 11 00 = Artifact - Ring of Khajiit
	People familiar with hacking the BIOG*.TXT files will probably see a
	similarity in the artifact/item codes and this reward type. Since the
	BIOG item codes are well documented, it 'should' be a breeze to add
	whatever item one desires as a quest reward (although how does one
	specify the material flag?)
    [Bytes 7-10] - unsigned long message_type
	This appears to be related to what reward type is used in
	the QRC file.  If you use _item_ in the QRC or _gold_ in the QRC this
	value will be different.
		30 06 00 00 = _gold_
		14 1B 00 00 = _reward_
		FE 67 00 00 = _artifact_
	Most of the codes in the QBN files are short int (with the last two bytes
	being zero). There are a few files where the 3rd byte contains a number
	although it appears all files have a 00 for the last byte.
    [Bytes 11-14] - unsigned long null_bytes
		00 00 00 00 (confirmed)
	After parsing all the QBN files for DF, it appears that these 4 bytes are
	always 0.  One should still save these bytes on a read just in case.
    [Bytes 15-16] - unsigned int message_id1
	Message ID #1 or 0. If message ID is not 0 the message with the given
	ID in the QRC file will be displayed when item is given (unconfirmed).
    [Bytes 17-18] - unsigned int message_id2
	Message ID #2 or 0.  If this number is given the message ID is displayed
	when the item is used/looked at.  Commonly employed for letters etc...
	(un-confirmed).

  [qbn_section_offset[1] - Bytes 38 to 39 = qbn_section_offset[5] and [6] ]
	Always empty. These three offsets always seem to be the same...why?

  [qbn_section_offset[2] - Bytes 40 to 41]
	Always empty.

  [qbn_section_offset[3] - Bytes 42 to 43]
	This section is related to quest characters, such as those you meet
	in dungeons or taverns, or even the quest givers.
    [Bytes 0] (char) - Index number.
    [Byte 1-2] (int) - Unknown, but has one of four values (confirmed).
	Perhaps whether the gender of the person is random, male or female.
	All these values are unconfirmed
		00 FF = Random
		00 8C = Unknown, only occurs once in C0B10Y07
		00 00 = Male
		00 01 = Female
    [Bytes 3-7] - Unknown. Contains a wide variety of values here.
    [Bytes 8-11] (long) - Message hash value (see Appendix E)
    [Bytes 12-15] (long) - NULL bytes (all zeros) (confirmed)
    [Bytes 16-17] (int) - Optional quest text index number.
    [Bytes 18-19] (int) - Optional quest text index number.


  [qbn_section_offset[4] - Bytes 44 to 45]
	This section relates the locations required in the quest such as 
	a house, taverns, dungeons, etc...
    [Byte 0] (char) - Index number (confirmed)
    [Bytes 1-2] (int) - Null bytes, always 00 00 (confirmed)
    [Byte 3] (char) - General Location
	 	  00 = Unknown?
		  01 = Quest is in current town (kill the animal in house)
		  02 = Quest is outside of current town (dungeon, far town)
    [Bytes 4-5] (int) - Secondary location type
		00 00 = Quest is inside a house (random)
		01 00 = Quest is inside a dungeon (random)
	        ## C3 = There are a few quests which have this form (like 58 C3, 63 C3, etc...), most of them
	  		being the main quest files S*.QBN.  This probably gives the location of specific locations
			such as Shedungent, Castle Daggerfall, etc... but this is unconfirmed at the moment.
    [Bytes 6-7] (int) - Unknown value with the possible values (very close to confirmed)
		00 00 to 14 00 = ???
		FF FF = ???
		01 FA = ???
		02 FA = ???
		04 FA = ???
		08 FA = ???
	 	09 FA = ???
    [Bytes 8-9] (int) - Unknown value but takes one of three possible values (confirmed)
		FF FF = ???
		00 00 = ???
		01 00 = ???
    [Byte 10] (char) - Unknown value but takes one of three possible values (confirmed). This value appears to remain
	constant throughout any multiple location sections in a quest file.
		FF = ???
		61 = ???
		00 = ???
    [Byte 11] (char) -  Unknown value which takes on a wide range of values.  This value appears to remain
	constant throughout any multiple location sections in a quest file. Bytes 9 and 10 may be actually an
	integer value rather than two characters.
    [Bytes 12-15] (long) - Message hash value (see Appendix E)
    [Bytes 16-19] (long) - Null bytes, always 00 00 00 00 (confirmed) 
    [Bytes 20-21] (int) - An optional quest text index
    [Bytes 22-23] (int) - Another optional quest text index


  [qbn_section_offset[5] - 46 to 47 ]
	Always empty.

  [qbn_section_offset[6] - 48 to 49]
	Somehow related to the length of the quest.
    [Bytes 0-1] (int) - Index number
    [Byte 2] (char) - Somehow related to quest length? Possible confirmed values are...
		01 = 
	  	02 =
		09 =
		0C =
		11 =
		12 =
    [Byte 3] (char) - Related to quest length? Possible confirmed values are...
		00 =
		01 =
		02 = 
		03 = 	 
    [Byte 4] (char) - Related to quest length? Possible Confirmed values are...
		00 = 
		01 = 
		02 = 
		03 = 
		04 = 
		05 = 
	The Bytes 1-4 may actually be integer or long data.
    [Bytes 5-8] (long) - Unknown number taking a number of possible values
    [Bytes 9-12] (long) - Unknown number with many possible values
    [Bytes 13-20] (long, long) - Null Bytes, always 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 (confirmed)
    [Bytes 21-22] (int) - Unknown value
    [Byte 23] (char) - Unknown with possible confirmed values...
		00 = 
		01 = 
		FC = 
    [Bytes 24-27] (long) - Message Hash Value (see Appendix E)
    [Byte 28] (char) - Unknown value with confirmed possible values of
		01 = 
		C8 = 
    [Bytes 29-32] (long) - Unknown value, possibly message hash

  [qbn_section_offset[7] - 50 to 51]
	This section relates to any mob found in the quest. This could be
	an orc, rat, assassin, etc...
    [Byte 0] (char) - Index number
    [Bytes 1-2] (int) - NULL bytes, always 00 00 (confirmed)
    [Byte 3] (char) - Mob index number, the confirmed known values are 
		0-40    = Regular monsters like rat, orc, daedras etc...
		128-141 = Human mobs like knights, thieves, etc...
	See Appendix F for numerical listing of monsters.
    [Bytes 4-5] (int) - Unknown value but is limited to (confirmed)
		1 = Most quests take this value
		2 =
		3 =
		4 =
		6 = 
    [Bytes 6-9] (long) - Message hash value (see Appendix E)
    [Bytes 10-13] (long) - NULL bytes always 00 00 00 00 (confirmed)


  [qbn_section_offset[8] - 52 to 53]
    [Bytes 28-31] - Sometimes message ID
    [Bytes 58-59] - Sometimes message ID
    [Bytes 81-82] - Message ID, or 0xFFFF
    [Bytes 85-86] - 00 00

  [qbn_section_offset[9] - 54 to 55]
	Relates to flag indices (whatever they are...)
    [Bytes 0-1] (int) - Index number.
    [Bytes 2-3] (int) - Null (unconfirmed but pretty sure)
    [Bytes 4-7] (long) - Flag index. These are the numbers seen when you press
	the ' key with cheat codes enabled under patch v2.12 or later. They 
	appear to flag certain occurences during the quest such as killing the
	mob or finding an item.  It is still unsure exactly how this works.

  [qbn_section_offset[10] ]
	Is only included in a few files and exists at the end of the QBN file.

That basically wraps up what I know about the QBN files.  There still is 
quite a bit we don't know about 'em.


CREDITS
======================================================
I could not have done all this without much help from the many other 
Daggerfall addicts out there (list is in no particular order).

	Peggy Hanks - df4@juno.com - For donating much new information
		for the quest file formats.

	Lord Phoenix - gozer@esoterica.pt - For donating information on the
		files formats as well.

	Michael Schneider - slannesh@pacbell.net - Maintains a Quest Hacking
		guide on Daggerweb and has also created a quest editor for
		Windows, and of course has provided much new information. 

	Glen Wright - glen@skatter.usask.ca - Provided some more very useful
		information on the structure of the QBN files. 

If I've forgotten anyone I can assure you it's not on purpose. Just 
e-mail me and we'll clear things up in a jiffy (anyone know how long that
is perchance?).  

If you'd like to help out in some way, feel free to make it known to me
as I'm sure I could find something you could do. Just e-mail me at
aj589@freenet.carleton.ca   I'll take suggestions for the quest editor,
comments on this document, and of course any data on the quest formats.  


WHY Hack the Quest Files?
======================================================
Perhaps some of you are wondering why I am bothering to hack these files (and
no, it's not because they are there).  If the QBN file structure is found,
even if not fully complete, a Daggerfall Quest editor can be created.  This 
means user created quests can be made and added at will, hopefully improving
the variety of the quests currently found in the game.  Once the QBN file 
format is sufficiently known, I will begin creating such a program, that is
unless someone else wants to, or is planning to (please notify me).

APPENDIX B - Listing of _string_ Variables
======================================================
These variables are the largest part of the different variable types. The 
variable is usually descriptive enough but many of these variables don't
yet have a known function (simply due to lack of time and the sheer number
of them).

APPENDIX E - Description of Message Hash Values
======================================================
The message type values in the QBN fields were early identified with the 
different variable types used in the QRC texts, but a direct relationship
was undetermined.  It is now known that the values are related by the hash
value of the variable name as described below.

Pseudo-Code:
	Set Total = 0
	Current Character = 1st Character in variable name

	Begin Loop until End of Variable Name
		Shift Total left by 1 bit
		Take value of current character and add it to Total
		Move Current Character to next one
	End Loop 

	Total = Hash value of the Variable Name


In 'C' this program would be:
	( Code written by Michael P. Schneider - slannesh@pacbell.net )

	void hash(char *ptr) {
	  long int val = 0;
	  while(*ptr)
	    val = (val<<1) + *ptr++;
	  return (val);
	 }

Please note that while this works for most message types occasionally the 
message type value is related to something else.  This usually occurs when
the object has a message id related to it but not much other than this is

APPENDIX F - Listing of Monster Numbers
======================================================
Each monster has a particular number associated with it in the QBN file and
in other locations.  These are all the known values used in the QBN files.
There may be other values not yet discovered.  Any value with a ? is not
yet confirmed (ie, I guessed).
