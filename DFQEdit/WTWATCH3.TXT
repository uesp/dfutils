Well done, %pcf. Let me cast|
 this spell upon the _reward_|
 ... there. The _reward_ is now|
 safe and yours to keep.|
 |
 Not even death can hide a true descendant|
 of Tiber Septim from the Underking. King|
 Lysandus did not die in the battle of|
 Cryngaine. He was slain by treachery before|
 it. The monument to him in Hammerfell is an|
 empty tomb. His remains were secretly|
 taken to an ancient tomb in Menevia, which|
 I will now reveal to you. I do not know|
 who betrayed Lysandus, nor why his spirit|
 haunts the city of Daggerfall and not the|
 battlefield of Cryngaine. I have kept my|
 part of the bargain, and you have earned|
 the gratitude of the Underking.|
