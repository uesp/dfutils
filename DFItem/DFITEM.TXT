   INTRODUCTION
=======================================
Welcome to DFItem, a simply DOS utility allowing one to edit any and all
items contained in the Daggerfall save games.  I first created the program
for my own 'needs' to edit the savegame files.  I wanted to be able to sell
magical items at a proper cost, not the greatly reduced cost given in any
store.  From known information about the SAVETREE.DAT file and through
hacking I was quickly able to determine the format and create this simple
program.  Seeing that there was only one program, DFHack, that could edit
items in any way, I decided to release this since it included a few
additional features....Enjoy.



   INSTALLING
=======================================
DFItem must be installed in the root directory of Daggerfall, usually
something like C:\DAGGER\ etc... If you do not install it there it will not
be able to find the savegame directories and will complain.  All that is
needed to run the program is the DFITEM.EXE file, and, of course, some
Daggerfall save games.


   USING DFItem
=======================================
DFItem has a simple user interface which you should find very easy to use.
To load a game merely click on the 'Load' button to display a list of
available savegames.  Select the one you wish to load all the items from
that file.  It is entirely possible to run out of memory if you have too
many items in the savegame.  You may now edit the various fields such as
item name, cost, uses, type etc...  Please note that it is entirely possible
to enter an invalid number in some fields that might cause 'undocumented'
behavior in Daggerfall.  At any rate, making backups of the file SAVETREE.DAT
before editting is always a good idea.  In order to save your changes make
sure you press the 'Save' button before you load another game or exit.

There are a number of buttons other than the obvious 'Load' and 'Exit' which
may need explaining.  The 'Next' and 'Prev' buttons move ahead to the next
item in the list, as do the PgUp and PgDn keys.  The '+Mag' and '-Mag'
buttons move to the next magical item found, if any, as do the Up and Down
cursor keys (useful if you wish to edit the enchantments of some of your
magical toys). The three 'Find' related buttons help you look for a
particular item by name and type.  Enter the string to search for by pressing
the 'Find Item' key.  Now, use the 'Find Next' and 'Find Prev' buttons to
find all the items matching your query.  The 'Fix' button, or ALT-F, fixes
the item to a condition of New.


The 'Sell' button, also ALT-S, displays a window prompting you if you wish
to sell the item for the calculated cost.  The calculated cost is based on
the base item price, plus the material modifier, plus the enchantments.
Currently, the base item price for most items is incorrect, defaulting to 10
gold (so most non-magical items may have an incorrect calculated cost).  The
selling price is based on 1/2 the calculated cost modified slightly by your
characters personality. Selling an item will turn it into a Letter of Credit
of the appropiate amount. If you sell a large number of items you may wish to
visit a bank shortly thereafter to deposit them.


   ENCOUNTERING BUGS
=======================================
I've edited, saved, and tested many savegames with Daggerfall v2.13 with
absolutely no problems.  It should work fine with earlier version but since
I haven't tried it, I cannot guaruntee that it will.  If you do find a bug
or have any problems, please contact me at aj589@freenet.carleton.ca


    TECHNICAL STUFF
=======================================
Not going to include any of the format/structure information since it is
rather long and complex and has been written nicely by others. As usual, the
source code of the program is freely available...just email me a request.



    LEGAL STUFF
=======================================
I am in no way connected or related to Bethesda.  This is a third party
software and can not be guarunteed to work 100% correctly or not mangle
savegames etc... I cannot be held responsible for any damage incurred
through its use.

This program and its source code is public domain and can be freely copied
and distributed at will.  If you do use any of the source I would consider
it polite to be given credit where it is due.
