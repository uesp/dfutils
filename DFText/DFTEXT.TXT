   USING DFText
=======================================
DFText is a simple utility for adding, modifying, or deleting text entries
from the file TEXT.RSC in the ARENA2 directory of Daggerfall.  This is a
program meant for those interested and familiar with hacking and probably
shouldn't be used by your average gamer. Because of this, the documentation
will be rather sparse since I'm assuming you probably are familiar with
hacking and with the Daggerfall files to some degree.  You may always email
me with any questions/comments.

I developed this initially for adding texts for new artifacts, although you
can do much more. In general, it is dangerous to delete texts unless you
added it previously.  Deleting a text the game needs may cause the game to
crash when it looks for it, although an error message is more likely.  To
use this program, merely copy it into the root Daggerfall directory. The
basic commands available are as follows:

   DFText [/d] [/y] [/s] [text file] index

	index : This is the text index you wish to view, change, modify
		or delete. It can range from 0 to 65535 and be a decimal or
		hex number (0xFF).  This is required.
  [text file] : If adding or modifying a text entry, this specified the
		source text to use. Make sure text lines are in general
		shorter than 50-60 chararacters or so, so that the displayed
		lines in Daggerfall aren't too long. At the moment no special
		'codes' are available, but may be in the future. This is
		required unless you are deleting an entry.
	 [/d] : Means you wish to delete the specified index number from
		the RSC file.
	 [/y] : Defaults yes to all answers.  Use this if you don't want to
		be prompted for deleting and replacing records.
	 [/s] : Saves the specified text file to the text index. Use this to
		replace or add text indices.

   EXAMPLES
=======================================

	dftext 8720		:Delete text
	dftext 8720 /y		:Delete text with no prompts
	dftext /y 8720		:Delete text with no prompts
	dftext 8720 file.txt	:Save the text index 8720 to the text file
	dftext 8720 file.txt /s :Add/replace index 8720 with file



   TEXT.RSC STRUCTURE
=======================================
The structure of the TEXT.RSC file is relatively simple. The first part of
the file is a group of headers, indicating the offset and type of the texts
contained.

     Bytes[0-1] (short)
	The length, in bytes, of the header, not counting these 2 bytes.

     Header Structure
	Bytes[0-1] (short)
	    The index of the text record. The index is used by the program
	    in order to tell which text is to be displayed when. IE, when it
	    wants to display an artifact text description it will look for
	    the index 8720 in the file.
	Bytes[2-5] (long)
	    Offset to the beginning of the text from the start of the file.
     End Header

There are a number of special indices used by the program.
	0x0F00 = Last dummy record in file, must be present.
	0xFFFF = Offset points to byte after last byte in file

What follows the header is all the text data. Much like the text data
contained in the QRC and book files, it contains special codes.
	0xFE = End of Text Section
	0xFC = Carriage Return
	0xFD = Carriage Return
