   INTRODUCTION
========================================
The two programs, DFArtMod and DFAComp, allow Daggerfall 'developers' to
create unique items and artifacts and allow regular Daggerfall users to use
these artifacts easily in the game.  At the moment adding artifacts to the
game is indeed a 'black art' as these programs are sure to contain lots of
bugs.  I have successfully added artifacts to the game myself but I cannot
guaruntee 100% success just yet.  Comments, bugs, errors, etc... are all
very welcome at the above e-mail address.


   QUICK GUIDE TO ARTIFACT CREATION
========================================
     - Run DFAComp to create your artifacts and your description of them.
       Make sure to use unique indices for them.
     - Use the 'Check' button to ensure everything is ok.
     - Save the artifacts to an AMD file.
     - Create a quest using your new artifact(s).  The item code for your
       new artifact will be group 5, sub-group equal to the artifact index.
     - Copy the AMD file to the Daggerfall directory.
     - Backup the files MAGIC.DEF and TEXT.RSC (important).
     - Use DFArtMod to extract the AMD file into the MAGIC.DEF and TEXT.RSC
       file:  dfartmod file.amd
     - Load up Daggerfall, get your new quest, and get your artifact.



   CREATING THE ARTIFACTS (DFAComp)
========================================
The program DFAComp is used by those wishing to create a unique artifact for
the game.  There are two steps in doing so: creating the magic item, and
creating the descriptive text.  For the moment I'll assume you're at least
slightly familiar with editting or hacking Daggerfall files.  The user
interface should work fine, although there are a few minor bugs which I still
haven't fixed yet.

The magic item screen in DFAComp allows you to change the enchantments of the
item, its name and type among other things.  All the known enchantments are
there to choose from, although certain ones may not work effectively (such
as casting heal when held for example).  The item type chooses the general
type and the appearance of the item.  I've always choosen regular item types
such as armour and weapons.  Choosing an existing artifact as a type or a
non-usable item (like ingrediants) may not work or have 'interesting' effects.
I've also noticed that although you specify the material type, on some items
the material color isn't properly displayed.  It will still be that material,
but merely look like regular steel.  The artifact index is very important and
is disscussed later on.

To go along with each new artifact must be a descriptive text, otherwise the
user will get an error message when getting 'info' on the artifact. Don't use
too long a line (somewhat shorter than the size of the text window) or it
will not display properly.  Make sure the text index matches the artifact
index.  The text index can be changed by double clicking on the text index
in the list.

The 'Check' button at the bottom of the screen is important.  It allows you
to make sure your current set of artifacts is safe.  It makes sure you
haven't used any invalid artifact indices and that there are matching text
and artifact entries.

When saving, use the AMD format (which should be automatically used anyways)
in order to identify the files as Artifact MoDules.


   THE ARTIFACT INDEX
========================================
The artifact index is probably the most important value and much can be said
about it.  The index is a unique number which identifies the artifact as well
as its descriptive text.  The current set of artifacts in Daggerfall use the
indices from 0 to 22 so those are obviously off limits.  Also, you should not
use any artifact index which someone else has already used or is planning to
use, otherwise someone who wishes to install both artifact packs will be
messed up since some artifacts will overwrite others.  At the moment, I'm
not sure what the limit on the index is.  It is either 100, 127, or 255 so
attempt to keep index numbers less than 100 for the moment (this leaves 78
new user artifacts to be defined which should be plenty).


   USING THE ARTIFACT (QUESTS)
========================================
Now that you've created your wonderful artifact, how do you use it in the
game.  To acquire your artifact you must create a quest for it.  A simple
method is to take an existing artifact quest and merely change the item
code.  The item code for your artifact will be group 5 with the subgroup
being your artifact index (ie, from 23 on up).  I won't go into detail about
how to edit quests since there are several documents already out there. There
are also several good quest editors to do this (WinQEdit and DMPQuest for
example).  If at all possible, try to change the quest as much as possible
to make things more interesting.  Its easy to change all the texts in the
quests yet still have the same quest type.  Also try to make your quests
available in various guilds, ones that don't normally have artifact quests
(like temples).


   INSTALLING THE ARTIFACTS (DFArtMod)
========================================
All the artifacts and texts in a saved AMD file can be installed by using
the DFARTMOD file. Merely use the syntax

		DFArtMod file.amd

while in the Daggerfall directory. This will put all the artifacts into
the MAGIC.DEF file and all the texts in the TEXT.RSC file. The various
options for the program are as follows:

		/? ...... Display help screen
		/v ...... View info on AMD file, do not extract.
		/c ...... Check AMD for errors and conflicts.
		/y ...... Answer Yes to all prompts

Its probably a _very_ good idea to create backups of the files that are
modified.  As I said, although I've used it without problems doesn't mean
that there aren't any.  If you wish, you could release a BAT file along with
your AMD file to automatically install and backup things, ie:

		@echo off
		copy arena2\magic.def arena2\magic.102
		copy arena2\text.rsc  arena2\text.102
		echo Files have been backed up with the 102 extension.
		DFArtMod /y myfile.amd
		echo MyFile artifacts have been installed...enjoy.
		@echo on

Please note that unless you haven't patched the game, you cannot merely copy
TEXT.RSC from the CD-ROM.  You'll have to reinstall your patch.  I'm not
sure about MAGIC.DEF.
