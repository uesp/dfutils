INSTALLATION WALK-THROUGH


The best way to install is to create a DAGPIC directory in
your main DAGGER directory.  By using the the DAGPIC.CFG you
don't have to have all your files in the ARENA2 directory
(there's enough files in there already).  I have successfully
changed my character potrait so I know it works although I
haven't fully tested it.  Please report any bugs/problems
ASAP.  Read the included text file for more info and examples
on use. Enjoy...
