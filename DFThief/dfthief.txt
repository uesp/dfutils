  INTRODUCTION
---------------------------------------
DFThief is a DOS command line program which can edit your Daggerfall save games,
allowing you to become a member of the Thieves Guild or Dark Brotherhood after
you have been expelled, by regular means or vampirism.  It is currently in the
testing phase.


  INSTALLATION
---------------------------------------
To install, merely copy the file DFTHIEF.EXE into your Daggerfall directory.
There are minimal computer requirements so if you can run Daggerfall, you can
run DFThief.


  USE
---------------------------------------
The program will only work if you were once a member of the Thieves Guild or
Dark Brotherhood and have since been expelled.  This can be from loss of 
repuation over time, not completing quests, or by contracting vampirism. You
should first use the program REP to ensure your reputation with the guild 
is positive, otherwise you may not be invited.  Next, simply run DFThief as
the following examples illustrate:

	DFThief # /t
	DFThief # /d

These edit the save game # (0-5) and set the thief/dark brotherhood flags,
hopefully allowing you to receive an invitation to join that guild.  More
command line options can be seen by type "DFThief /?".  Do not set both 
the Thieves Guild and DB flags at the same time as you may only receive
one invitation.  Instead, set one flag, complete the invitation quest, and
then set the other. 


  BACKUPS
---------------------------------------
A backup of your savegame will be created when you run DFThief, although you 
may wish to create a complete backup of your savegame for a later restore if
the program does something unexpected.
