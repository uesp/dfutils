   USING DEFEDIT
=======================================
DEFEdit is a utility allowing one to edit the file MAGIC.DEF in the ARENA2
directory of Daggerfall.  This isn't meant for the average gamer, but those
familiar and interested in hacking magical items and artifacts in Daggerfall.
As such the documentation will be rather brief...feel free to email me any
questions, comments, bugs, etc...

The use of DEFEdit should be relatively easy. Make sure the program is in the
main Daggerfall directory since that is where it assumes it will be (it
automatically loads MAGIC.DEF on startup).  Things are not saved
automatically so make sure you saved before exiting (save via ALT-S or the
button, exit via ALT-X or the button). As usual, you should make a backup
of the DEF file before you edit in case you editted version crashes the
game later on.

One can edit all fields as you please but understand it is very easy to make
something that doesn't work.  Enchanting an ingrediant with a 'Cast when
Held' makes no sense since it can never be held.  Also, one shouldn't touch
the Magic Type field for the existing items from 0 to 59. If you change a
regular item to an artifact or vice-versa the indices for the existing
artifacts will be messed up.
